function errorbar_tick(h,w,xtype)
%ERRORBAR_TICK Adjust the width of errorbars
%   ERRORBAR_TICK(H) adjust the width of error bars with handle H.
%      Error bars width is given as a ratio of X axis length (1/80).
%   ERRORBAR_TICK(H,W) adjust the width of error bars with handle H.
%      The input W is given as a ratio of X axis length (1/W). The result
%      is independent of the x-axis units. A ratio between 20 and 80 is usually fine.
%   ERRORBAR_TICK(H,W,'UNITS') adjust the width of error bars with handle H.
%      The input W is given in the units of the current x-axis.
