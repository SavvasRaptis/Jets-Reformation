function unfreezeColors(h)
% unfreezeColors  Restore colors of a plot to original indexed color. (v2.3)
%
%   Useful if you want to apply a new colormap to plots whose
%       colors were previously frozen with freezeColors.
%
%   Usage:
%       unfreezeColors          unfreezes all objects in current axis,
%       unfreezeColors(axh)     same, but works on axis axh. axh can be vector.
%       unfreezeColors(figh)    same, but for all objects in figure figh.
%
%       Has no effect on objects on which freezeColors was not already called.
%				(Note: if colorbars were frozen using cbfreeze, use cbfreeze('off') to
%       unfreeze them. See freezeColors for information on cbfreeze.)
%
%
%   See also freezeColors, freezeColors_pub.html, cbfreeze.

%   Changes:
%   JRI 9/1/06 now restores any object with frozen CData;
%              can unfreeze an entire figure at once.
%   JRI 4/7/10 Change documentation for colorbars
