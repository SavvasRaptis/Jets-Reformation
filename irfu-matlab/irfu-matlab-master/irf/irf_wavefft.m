% NAME
%   irf_wavefft: Short-Time Fourier Transform.
% SYNOPSIS
%   [S, F, T] = irf_wavefft(x, [window], [frame_overlap], [frame_length],
%               [fs])
% DESCRIPTION
%   Short-Time Fourier Transform
% INPUTS
%   x      (vector) of size Nx1. --- onedimension array
%   window (string) the window function such as rectwin, hamming.
%           if not specified, equivalent to hamming
%   frame_overlap
%          (scalar) the length of each frame overlaps in micro second.
%           The default is frame_length / 2.
%   frame_length
%          (scalar) the length of each frame in micro second.
%           The default is 20ms.
%   fs     (scalar) the sampling rate in Hz. The default assumes 16kHz
% OUTPUTS
%   S      (matrix) of size MxK where M is the size of each frame(fft))
%           and K is the number of frames. S is spectrogram (complex number)
%   F      (vector) of size Mx1 that is a vector of frequencies (y-axis)
%           in Hz.
%   T      (vector) of size 1xK whose value corresponds to the center of
%           each frame (x-axis) in sec.
