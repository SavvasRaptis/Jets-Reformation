% Extract file/directory/object name from path.
% 
%
% ARGUMENTS
% =========
% path : NOTE: Will interpret anything after last filesep as filename, including
%        ".." or ".", or empty string for paths that end with filesep.
%        NOTE: Path is not required to exist, since it is only used for a string
%        operation.
%        IMPORTANT NOTE: If path ends with slash, then the name is an empty string.

function [name, parentPath] = get_name(path)
    % PROPOSAL: Generalize to accepting cell array of paths.
    %   PRO: More convenient.
    %   CON: Easy to use cellfun.
    %       Ex: cellfun(@EJ_library.fs.get_name, {DsmdArray1.path}', 'UniformOutput', false)
    %   CON: Provides no extra value, e.g. speed (except convenience).
    %   CON: Output would have to change to cell arrays.
    %
    % PROPOSAL: Remove trailing slash.
    
    [parentPath, basename, suffix] = fileparts(path);
    name = [basename, suffix];
