The EJ_library package contains reusable general-purpose library code written by Erik P G Johansson, hence the package name. It is effectively a MIRROR of a subset of Erik P G Johansson's otherwise "personal" code which was not necessarily written with the intent of being shared. It is included since it is used by Solar Orbiter/RPW code authored by Erik P G Johansson in the irfu-matlab git repo, in particular the dataset calibration code BICAS.

WARNING: The author sometimes UNILATERALLY DECIDES TO MAKE BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES, OR REMOVE CODE WITHOUT WARNING. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

WARNING: THIS CODE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED BY OTHERS OR USED FOR OTHER REASONS, THOUGH IT CAN BE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

NOTE: Deliberately excludes automatic test code.
