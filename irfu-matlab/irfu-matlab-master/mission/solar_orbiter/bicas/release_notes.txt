Release notes
=============


Version 1.0.0
-------------
Almost-complete support for LFR & TDS datasets (voltages) with transfer
functions (partially tested). No parasitic capacitance.


Version 2.0.0
-------------
Added support for L1 input bias current datasets; supports updated L1R input
datasets, and updated L2 master CDFs (V08).


Version 2.0.1
-------------
Bugfix: Reads bias current zVars as nA (not uA)


Version 3.0.0
-------------
Functionality for ITF high freq. cutoff.
Uses master CDFs V09 (instead of V08).
Copies zVar BW from LFR datasets.
Searches for BIAS RCT using other filenaming scheme: *RPW-BIAS*.
L2 bias current in nA (not ampere).
Uses LFR mux mode.


Version 3.1.0
-------------
Bugfix to handle LFR zVar BW=0.
Preliminary sweep removal.
Performance improvement (speed-up).
Preliminary setting of zVar QUALITY_FLAG (max 2).
Inofficial preliminary support for producing L2-->L3.


Version 3.1.1
-------------
Modified default settings:
(1) inverted transfer function cutoff at 0.8*omega_Nyquist (instead of 0.7)
(2) duplicate bias current gives error (instead of using mitigation)


Version 4.0.0
-------------
Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table for setting QUALITY_FLAG, L2_QUALITY_BITMASK (new)
Set glob.attr. Datetime, OBS_ID, SOOP_TYPE, TIME_MIN, TIME_MAX
Modified default setting: PROCESSING.L1R.LFR.ZV_QUALITY_FLAG_BITMASK_EMPTY_POLICY=ERROR


Version 4.1.0
-------------
Added setting quality variables based on thruster firings in
Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table. List complete until 2020-12-05.
Zero order AC detrending (remove mean, not linear fit), no AC re-trending
(~bugfix; re-trending makes no sense for high-pass filtered data).
Combined transfer functions (LFR+BIAS) for AC data are modified during
execution to have constant gain for low freqs (prevents low frequency noise
from being amplified.)
Bugfix: glob.attr. Datetime, OBS_ID, SOOP_TYPE
Bugfix: not crashing when reading CURRENT datasets with one bias setting.


Version 5.0.0
-------------
Non-Standard Operations (NSO) table for thruster firings & saturation up until 2021-01-26.
Better output CDF standards compliance.
Using new master CDFs.
