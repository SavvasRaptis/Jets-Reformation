1. Use correctly averaged 4 sec B (where ?).
2. Need to save the info about which B was used.
3. Need to save the info about which probe pairs were used for P1234 and Es.
4. Need to substract VxB:
	a) for EDI PP which is in the inertial frame;
	b) for EFW, make new files mEIEdB and probably mEIDSI.
5. Load EDI quality factor.
6. Check ADC correction for throwing away too many points.
